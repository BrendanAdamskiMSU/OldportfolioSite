This is the repository for my portfolio website (brendanadamski.com)

creating this website has given me useful experience in committing, pushing code from VScode into Git, then onto Netlify

has also given me a fun HTML/CSS (and a bit of PHP) project!

currently working on figuring out mysql and xampp, hopefully i can run my php on the website
